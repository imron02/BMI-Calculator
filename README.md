# BMI Calculator
The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value and corresponding
weight status while taking age into consideration. Use the "Metric Units" tab for the 
International System of Units or the "Other Units" tab to convert units into either US 
or metric units. Note that the calculator also computes the Ponderal Index in addition to BMI, 
both of which are discussed below in detail.
